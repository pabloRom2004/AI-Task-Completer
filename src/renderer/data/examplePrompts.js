    // Game Development prompt - with numbered list
    `Develop a 2D platformer game with gravity-shifting mechanics. The game should:
  
  1. Allow the player to reverse gravity at will
  2. Feature puzzles that require creative use of gravity shifts
  3. Include at least 10 levels of increasing difficulty
  4. Have collectible items that unlock special abilities
  5. Feature a unique art style with vibrant colors and smooth animations
  
  The protagonist should be a robot exploring a research facility after an experiment goes wrong. Each level should introduce a new mechanic or obstacle that builds on previous levels.`,

    // Mobile App Development prompt - flowing text only, no lists
    `Create a personal finance tracking mobile app with budgeting features. I need a comprehensive app that helps users track daily expenses and income. The app should be able to categorize transactions automatically and allow users to set monthly budgets for different spending categories. It's important that it visualizes spending patterns using charts and graphs, and sends notifications when approaching budget limits. Users should be able to sync data across multiple devices securely and export their financial data for tax purposes. The design needs to be clean and minimalist with dark mode support. It must work offline and sync when connection is restored. Security is absolutely critical since we're handling sensitive financial information. I'd like recommendations on the tech stack that would be best for this kind of application, particularly for cross-platform development that doesn't sacrifice performance or user experience.`,

    // Research Paper prompt - mixed format with section headings
    `I need to write a research paper on artificial intelligence ethics. The scope should include:
  
  HISTORICAL CONTEXT
  A brief history of AI development and when ethical concerns first emerged. Include early philosophical discussions and how they evolved as technology advanced.
  
  CURRENT CHALLENGES
  Examine bias in algorithms, privacy concerns, automation's impact on labor markets, and responsibility for AI decisions. Use real-world examples like facial recognition controversies and autonomous vehicle accidents.
  
  PROPOSED FRAMEWORKS
  Analyze existing ethical frameworks from academia, industry, and government bodies. Compare approaches from different cultural contexts (Western, Eastern, etc.).
  
  The paper should be approximately 5,000 words with a focus on practical implications rather than purely theoretical concerns. I want to conclude with actionable recommendations for policymakers and technology companies.`,

    // Book Writing prompt - pure flowing text
    `I want to write a mystery novel set in a remote coastal village during winter. The story centers around a local librarian who discovers an old manuscript that appears to predict deaths in the village. As strange occurrences begin matching events in the manuscript, she realizes she might be the only one who can prevent the next tragedy. The atmosphere should be atmospheric and slightly supernatural without fully committing to paranormal elements - leaving readers wondering if there's a rational explanation or something truly unexplainable. I'm aiming for a slow-burn mystery with rich character development, particularly exploring how isolated communities create their own dynamics and hierarchies. I struggle with plotting mysteries that offer enough clues without making the solution obvious, so I'd especially appreciate help with structuring the revelation of information and creating compelling red herrings. I want the setting to almost function as a character itself, with the harsh winter weather and isolation playing crucial roles in the unfolding events. The manuscript itself should have an interesting origin story that's gradually revealed throughout the novel.`,

    // Website Development prompt - mix of paragraphs and bullet points
    `Design a portfolio website for a professional photographer specializing in wildlife and landscape photography. The site needs to showcase images in the best possible way while still loading quickly.
  
  The photographer travels frequently to remote locations, so the site should include:
  • An interactive map showing photo locations
  • Galleries organized by region and subject matter
  • A blog section for sharing stories behind the photos
  
  The most important requirement is that the images display at optimal quality without sacrificing load times. The photographer has approximately 2,000 high-resolution images that need to be managed efficiently.
  
  The website should emphasize the visual content while maintaining a clean, minimalist interface that doesn't distract from the photography. The target audience includes potential clients (magazines, conservation organizations) and fine art buyers. Responsive design is essential since many users will view the site on mobile devices while traveling.`,

    // Educational Course prompt - mostly paragraphs with simple emphasis
    `I need to develop an online course teaching data analysis for environmental scientists. The course is aimed at researchers and field scientists who have strong domain knowledge but limited programming experience. It needs to take students from basic concepts to being able to process their own field data and create publication-ready visualizations.
  
  The course should start with fundamentals of Python specifically relevant to scientific data processing. Then it should progress through increasingly complex data manipulation techniques. The final modules should cover advanced visualization and basic machine learning applications for environmental data.
  
  IMPORTANT: All examples must use real-world environmental datasets. Students will be more engaged if they work with realistic data like water quality measurements, species population surveys, or climate records.
  
  Each module needs video lectures, coding exercises, quizzes, and a mini-project. I envision a 10-week course with approximately 4-6 hours of student work per week. I also want to incorporate some collaborative elements where students can share their analyses of provided datasets.`
